## Walkthrough of the program:
You will be asked to enter a regular expression. For example "a.b.c".
You will then be asked for a string for the program to try and match to the regular 
expression you have previously entered. For example, "abc".
You will then get a result "True" or "False" depending on if the string you entered
matches the regular expression you entered.
You will then be asked if you would like to continue. Type "Y" for yes and "N" for no.
If you say "N" for no the program will shut down.
